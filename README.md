# Heart_Diseases_Stages_prediction

Heart diseases pose a significant threat to global health, and timely prediction of disease stages is crucial for effective medical intervention. This project presents a comprehensive approach to predicting the stages of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The system leverages a dataset comprising diverse patient information, including clinical and demographic variables, to build accurate and reliable predictive models.

Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine are trained on historical patient data to identify patterns and relationships between risk factors and heart disease progression. The system aims not only to improve diagnostic accuracy but also to support proactive clinical decisions, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare delivery. These models classify individuals into various stages of the disease, enabling healthcare professionals to detect high-risk cases early and tailor personalized treatment plans.
